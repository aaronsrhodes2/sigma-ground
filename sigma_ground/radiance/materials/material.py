"""
Material — the bridge between atomic physics and visual appearance.

A Material has two sides:
1. Physics side: composition, density, bond strength (from QuarkSum, σ-dependent)
2. Optical side: color, reflectance, roughness (EM-based, σ-INVARIANT)

The key SSBM insight: light bounces off atoms via electromagnetism.
EM doesn't care about σ. So colors don't change near a black hole.
But the material's MASS changes (QCD-dependent), and its STRUCTURAL
INTEGRITY changes (bond strength is partly QCD).

This is physically correct and observationally testable.
