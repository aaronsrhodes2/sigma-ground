Friction physics from atomic-scale properties.

Three contributions to friction, all derived from the existing modules:

  1. Adhesive friction (Bowden-Tabor 1950):
     μ_adhesive = τ_interface / H
     where τ_interface = interfacial shear strength (from mechanical module)
           H = indentation hardness of softer material

     FIRST_PRINCIPLES: Friction arises from shearing adhesive junctions.
     Real contact area = F_normal / H (plastic deformation at asperity tips).
     Friction force = τ × A_real = τ × F_normal / H.
     Therefore μ = τ / H.

  2. Ploughing friction:
     μ_plough = (2/π) × √(depth / R_asp)
     Hard asperities dig into softer surface, displacing material.
     depth/R_asp ratio from hardness mismatch.

     FIRST_PRINCIPLES: geometry of rigid conical/spherical indenter.
     APPROXIMATION: assumes rigid harder asperities, plastic softer surface.

  3. Real contact area (Greenwood-Williamson):
     A_real / A_apparent = P / H
     where P = nominal contact pressure, H = hardness.

     FIRST_PRINCIPLES: each asperity tip plastically deforms until
     contact pressure equals hardness. Total real area = load / hardness.

Hardness model:
  H ≈ 3 × σ_yield ≈ 3 × τ_theoretical / C
  where C is a constraint factor (~30 for theoretical → real yield)
  τ_theoretical = G/(2π) from Frenkel model (mechanical module)

  Tabor relation: H ≈ 3σ_y (FIRST_PRINCIPLES: slip-line field theory)
  σ_y ≈ τ_th / 30 (APPROXIMATION: ratio of theoretical to real yield)
  Net: H ≈ τ_th / 10

  This gives hardness from first-principles shear modulus, with one
  empirical factor (the theoretical-to-real strength ratio).

σ-dependence:
  σ → E_coh → G → τ_theoretical → H → μ
  σ → E_coh → γ → adhesion → τ_interface → μ
  Both channels modify the friction coefficient.

Origin tags:
  - Bowden-Tabor model: FIRST_PRINCIPLES (force balance at junctions)
  - Hardness from shear modulus: FIRST_PRINCIPLES (Tabor) + APPROXIMATION (τ_th/σ_y ratio)
  - Ploughing: FIRST_PRINCIPLES (indenter geometry) + APPROXIMATION (asperity shape)
  - Interfacial shear = min(τ₁, τ₂): APPROXIMATION (ignores junction strengthening)

# ── Friction coefficient (adhesive) ──────────────────────────────

def friction_coefficient(mat1, mat2, sigma=SIGMA_HERE):
    """Adhesive friction coefficient (Bowden-Tabor model).

    μ = τ_interface / H_softer

    The friction force equals the interfacial shear strength times
    the real contact area. The real contact area equals the load
    divided by the hardness of the softer material.

    F_friction = τ_interface × A_real
               = τ_interface × (F_normal / H_softer)
    μ = F_friction / F_normal = τ_interface / H_softer

    FIRST_PRINCIPLES: force balance at adhesive junctions.
    APPROXIMATION: τ_interface = min(τ₁, τ₂), H from τ_th/10.

    For self-contact (mat1 == mat2):
      μ = τ / H = τ / (τ_th/10) = 10 × (τ/τ_th)
      Since τ_interface = τ_th for self-contact: μ = 10
      But that's for theoretical shear strength. Real junctions are
      weaker, so we use τ_interface = τ_th / 10 (defect-weakened):
      μ_adhesive = (τ_th/10) / (τ_th/10) = 1.0

      Wait — that's circular. The issue is that both τ_interface and H
      derive from the same τ_th. Let's be more careful:

      Hardness: H = 3σ_y = 3 × τ_th/C₁ where C₁ ~ 30 (theory→real)
      Interface shear: τ_i = τ_th/C₂ where C₂ ~ 10 (clean junction)

      μ = τ_i / H = (τ_th/C₂) / (3τ_th/C₁) = C₁/(3C₂)
      μ = 30/(3×10) = 1.0

      For dissimilar: τ_i from weaker, H from softer.
      If they're the same material: μ ≈ 1.0
      If hard on soft: τ_i from soft, H from soft → μ ≈ 1.0
      If soft on hard: same by symmetry.

      This gives μ ≈ 1.0 for all clean metal pairs, which is actually
      close to experimental (0.5-1.5 for clean metals in vacuum).
      The variation comes from oxide films, junction strengthening,
      and elastic recovery — all second-order effects.

    To get material-dependent variation, we use the full τ and H values
    which have different material dependencies through their structure
    factors and Poisson ratios.
