"""
The Carbon Cigar: gas-phase physics test.

Setup:
  A cylinder of porous compressed carbon (the "cigar"), lit at one end.
  On the mouth end: a spherical vacuum chamber, sealed against the
  cigar but allowing gas/smoke through.

  The vacuum pulls air through the burning carbon. Combustion products
  (CO₂, CO, soot particles) flow through the porous carbon column
  and collect in the sphere.

Physics stack:
  1. Combustion: C + O₂ → CO₂ (complete) or 2C + O₂ → 2CO (incomplete)
     Enthalpy from bond energies via Hess's law (FIRST_PRINCIPLES).

  2. Darcy flow: v = −(κ_perm / η) × ∇P
     Flow through porous medium (FIRST_PRINCIPLES: Darcy 1856).
     κ_perm from Kozeny-Carman equation (FIRST_PRINCIPLES for packed beds).

  3. Temperature profile: gas cools as it flows through the cigar.
     Heat transfer to carbon walls (Newton cooling).

  4. Vacuum sphere: gas fills a known volume.
     PV = nRT gives pressure from accumulated moles.

  5. Soot emission: incomplete combustion produces C nanoparticles.
     These glow as blackbodies at the combustion temperature.
     Push rendering from matter — even in a gas phase.

  6. σ-spectroscopy: the CO₂ in the sphere has vibrational frequencies
     that depend on nuclear mass. Measure the spectrum → read σ.

Derivation chain from σ:
  σ → nuclear mass → molecular mass → gas density → Darcy flow rate
  σ → nuclear mass → reduced mass → vibrational frequencies
  σ → nuclear mass → combustion enthalpy (second order, through ZPE)
  σ → nuclear mass → viscosity → flow resistance

Measured inputs:
  - Bond dissociation energies (C=O, O=O, C-C): MEASURED, EM
  - Porosity of carbon cylinder: MEASURED (geometry)
  - Sphere volume: MEASURED (geometry)

Everything else: DERIVED.

      stabilization), not a simple single bond. The effective C-C in
