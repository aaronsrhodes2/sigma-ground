# sigma-ground — Project Instructions

**First time here?** Read [PLATINUM_RULES.md](../../PLATINUM_RULES.md) — this project inherits all universal rules there.
See also: [LOGGING_STANDARD.md](../../LOGGING_STANDARD.md) — format for session logs and operatic scene files.

## Session Persistence

Maintain `misc/SESSION_LOG.md` (append after each session) and create `misc/OPERATIC_PLAY_SCENE[N]_[TITLE].txt` files (prose narratives of discoveries).

See [LOGGING_STANDARD.md](../../LOGGING_STANDARD.md) for templates and formatting guidelines.

## Project Context

**The Codebase — Pure Python, zero external dependencies**

- `sigma_ground/` — Unified physics library.
  Three sub-packages:
  - `sigma_ground.inventory` — Particle inventory & mass closure.
    Resolves materials → molecules → atoms → particles → quarks.
    CLI: `python -m sigma_ground.inventory`
  - `sigma_ground.field` — σ-field scalar physics. Constants, bounds,
    entanglement, spacetime geometry. □σ = −ξR.
    Core: constants, scale, nucleon, binding, bounds, entanglement.
    New physics: relativity, electrodynamics, decay, gr_basics.
    Interface layer: thermal, optics, statistical, plasma, orbital, fluid,
    quantum, mechanical, semiconductor_optics, crystal_field, and more.
  - `sigma_ground.dynamics` — N-body dynamics, SPH fluid, Barnes-Hut
    gravity, leapfrog integrator.

- `GOLDEN_RULES.md` — Eight rules governing all physics code in this project.
- `tests/` — Full test suite (~1260+ tests).
- `examples/` — Five standalone usage examples.
- `misc/` — Session log and operatic play scenes (13+ scenes).

**MCP Server — Nagatha (v5.0.0)**
- Nagatha exposes the entire sigma-ground library as callable MCP tools.
- When asked to produce a **simulation**, **test**, **experiment**, or **scene**,
  use the MCP tools (`search`, `describe`, `list_functions`, `run`, `generate_test`)
  instead of reasoning about the physics yourself. Nagatha runs the real code;
  her results are authoritative.
- Workflow: `search` → `describe` → `run`. Use `list_functions`/`list_categories`
  for browsing. Use `generate_test` for automated test generation.
- **Test modes:**
  - `generate_test(mode="experiment")` — default. For end users running scenarios.
    Lightweight, no internal test boilerplate.
  - `generate_test(mode="development")` — for Aaron + Claude building modules.
    Full-coverage tests matching `test_*.py` patterns. Save as
    `sigma_ground/field/interface/test_<category>.py`.
- **Diagnostics:** Nagatha flags suspected bugs (bad sigma defaults, earth-sigma
  violations) but NEVER fixes them. Report findings to user for review.
- **Scientifically honest:** Nagatha reports what the code actually does, not
  what it should do. If a function produces a wrong value, the test captures
  that wrong value and flags it.

**Rendering lives in matter-shaper (sibling project at ../matter-shaper/)**

**Testing**
- pytest, 1260+ tests passing (1198 original + new physics modules)
- Run: `pytest` or `pytest -v -s`

**Key physics concepts (don't panic)**
- σ (sigma) field — scalar field governing scale transitions
- Space cavitation — compressed spacetime pocket, electromagnetically
  incommensurable with surrounding universe
- r_s / R_H identity — Schwarzschild radius equals Hubble radius at junction
- Bond failure layers — 8 bond types fail in order during BH formation
