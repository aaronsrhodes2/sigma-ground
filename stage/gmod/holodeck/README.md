# The holodeck (Garry's Mod)

Ask for things in plain words and real models appear, arranged the way a person would arrange them:

> **Skippy, add three couches.** → three couches in a U, open toward you, facing each other
> **Skippy, a table with six chairs.** → the smallest table that seats six, the chairs tucked in and looking at it
> **Skippy, a living room.** → couch facing the TV, coffee table between, armchairs flanking, a lamp and a plant in the corners
> **Skippy, put a lamp next to the couch. Turn the chair to face me. Remove the lamp. Undo. Clear the room.**

It never asks a clarifying question. Whatever is unclear resolves to the most sensible reading, and the reply says what it did
("there was no table, so I added one", "I don't have a dragon in my library").

## Using it

- **Chat or voice:** any sentence that starts with **Skippy** is a request. Everything else players say is left alone, so players with
  a live mic talk normally. In the console, `holodeck <words>` needs no wake word. Also `holodeck_status`, `holodeck_undo`, `holodeck_clear`,
  `holodeck_reload` (superadmin; re-reads which models the server has).
- **What it can build:** 46 kinds of everyday thing (seats, tables, beds, storage, lamps, appliances, bathroom, electronics, containers,
  plants) as 127 real Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source models, and seven whole rooms (living room, dining room, kitchen, bedroom,
  office, waiting room, bathroom). Colours ("a red couch") tint the model; size words pick a bigger or smaller model; counts are
  exact ("a dozen crates", "ten stools in a circle"). Arrangements: a row, a circle, a grid, a U or L, facing each other, stacked or
  scattered, against a wall or in a corner, around / beside / in front of / behind / on something that stands or that it adds.
- **What the models need:** the server must have the Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source content (the holodeck checks and leaves out
  what is missing); `holodeck_content hl2` restricts it to Half-Life 2 models, which every player has.
- **Safety on a shared server:** everyone's props belong to whoever made them (admins change anything) and are created as theirs
  (`SetCreator`, CPPI), the server's own spawn rules apply (`PlayerSpawnObject` and `PlayerSpawnProp`, asked with `hook.Run` so registered hooks and the gamemode's own function both count, and `sbox_maxprops` where the gamemode has no such function; an explicit `false` is a veto), a cooldown between requests (checked first, longer
  after an expensive one), caps per player and overall that undo also obeys, props of players who left make way for newcomers, a small
  planner time budget for ordinary players, Skippy's lines go only to the requester and those within earshot, and the bridge is
  rationed per player and per server. Details and the convars: [../CLOUD_SERVER.md](../CLOUD_SERVER.md).

## How it is built

```
words ─ parse.lua ─▶ request ─ plan.lua ─▶ poses ─ holodeck.lua (engine glue) ─▶ props in the world
          │                       │  uses layout.lua (geometry), catalog.lua (the library), library.lua (what this server has)
          └─ agent (optional): when the words build nothing, skippy_bridge.py asks a local model to turn the wish into a request,
             checked against the library before the game sees it
```

- `catalog_src.py` (curated: which model stands for which thing) + `measure.py` (the ENGINE's own bounds, mass, material, collision
  body, flat tops) + `data/front_overrides.json` (which side is the front, checked by eye on a photograph of every model:
  `contact_sheet.py`) → `build_catalog.py` → `addon/lua/mentat/holodeck/catalog.lua` (generated, do not edit).
- `parse.lua`, `layout.lua`, `plan.lua`, `library.lua` are pure Lua (no GMod globals) and are tested offline under LuaJIT.
  `holodeck.lua` is only engine glue (traces for floors and walls, spawning, chat, undo, ownership, the limits). It is tested offline
  too: `gmod_mock.lua` is a small stand-in for the Garry's Mod API (virtual clock, recorded net messages and HTTP calls, a flat world
  with walls and blockers you place) and `test_gmod_glue.py` runs the REAL `holodeck.lua`, `voice.lua` and the client files against it.

## Testing

```bash
pip install lupa pytest                                     # lupa = LuaJIT, the VM Garry's Mod uses (optional, test-only)
python -m pytest sigma_ground/radiance/tests/test_gmod_holodeck.py sigma_ground/radiance/tests/test_gmod_glue.py   # the planner/parser and the engine glue, a few seconds
python stage/gmod/holodeck/eval_parse.py --show 20          # the parser against 223 independently written and audited requests
python stage/gmod/holodeck/lab.py                           # (import) run any request in a synthetic world and grade it
```

The offline grader (`lab.py`) rebuilds every footprint from the engine-measured bounds, never from the planner's own numbers, and
checks floors, overlaps, walls, facing, tops. The live checks need the game files:

```bash
python stage/gmod/holodeck/live.py "add three couches" "a living room" --pos 64,0        # dedicated server, real physics, settled
python stage/gmod/holodeck/live.py "make it cozy" --start-bridge --persona --voice       # with the agent and Skippy's voice
python stage/gmod/holodeck/shots.py "a living room" --tag lr --top                       # photographs from several sides
python stage/gmod/holodeck/skippy_e2e.py                                                 # a spoken request through the real game
```

`live.py` grades what the physics engine left standing: nothing shoved, sunk, toppled, inside a wall, or overlapping, and everything
asleep after settling.

## Skippy: agent, voice, ears (all optional)

| Piece | Where it runs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `skippy_bridge.py` | next to the game server | `/plan` (a local model turns a vague wish into a validated request), `/reply` (Skippy's persona says what was done), `/speak` (an mp3). Fixed actions only, behind a token. |
| `skippy_ears.py` | each player's own PC | reads the microphone into a short memory (about a second and a half), and when the game says the player is transmitting, has the sentence recognised by the LOCAL Whisper; only a sentence that starts with "Skippy" is handed to the game (`--list` shows the microphones it can see) |
| `skippy_client.lua` | the game client | tells the ears when the player transmits (and keeps saying so while the key is down, so a crash is noticed within seconds); plays Skippy's voice in 3D from where he built things |

**Running the bridge.** It refuses to start without a token: put the same value in `SKIPPY_BRIDGE_TOKEN` (or `--token-file`) for the
bridge and in the server's `holodeck_bridge_token`; `--no-token` exists for a bridge on loopback only. Requests from a web page, without a
JSON body, or with a foreign Host are refused. Its work is bounded (a few connections, short queues for the model and the voice,
per-minute budgets per endpoint and per player, a daily budget for the paid voice); when it is full it answers 429 or 503 (and 501 where
the machine has no voice at all) and the game falls back to plain text. Everything the model says is cleaned and checked before it is
spoken or shown, and the game rations its own calls on top (see [../CLOUD_SERVER.md](../CLOUD_SERVER.md)). On Linux there is no
Windows speech: use `--tts auto` or `elevenlabs`.

Voices: `--tts auto` (the launcher's default: Skippy's own ElevenLabs voice through SkippyTel, Windows speech if that is not available;
it costs API credit per character, capped by the bridge's daily allowance), `elevenlabs` (his voice only, or nothing) or `sapi` (Windows speech,
free; the bridge's own default when you start it by hand). The game prints "Skippy's voice is now: elevenlabs" (or sapi) when the voice that
speaks changes. A dedicated server reaches the bridge on localhost with `-allowlocalhttp` (already in `gmod_ds_ctl.sh`);
a game that hosts its own world must use the machine's Tailscale address (the engine's flag works on servers only).

## Playing with your voice (one command)

```bash
bash stage/gmod/skippy_play.sh                 # the bridge, your microphone and the game, started in order and wired together
bash stage/gmod/skippy_play.sh --selftest-voice "add two couches" --stop-after     # prove the voice path with no human
```

`play.py` checks SkippyTel's Whisper, Ollama, ffmpeg, your microphone and your Tailscale address, starts the bridge behind a fresh token,
starts the game as a small listen server, connects the game to the bridge (`mentat/tools/skippy_play.lua`, run through the same
`data/mentat/tool.txt` mechanism as every other tool) and starts the microphone bridge. Then **hold X and say what you want** (no wake
word; `--key` or the `skippy_key` setting picks another key), or hold V and start with "Skippy". The key is read by the game itself,
because the server may not bind keys for a player. The self-test speaks a request with Windows speech to the microphone bridge's own
recogniser (the real Whisper), lets the game pick it up and checks that things were built and Skippy's answer played in the game;
only the physical microphone and the key press are left to a human. Sentences longer than about 4 seconds are compressed before they
are uploaded (SkippyTel refuses bodies over 128 KB).

## Proximity voice

Native to the server (`mentat/voice.lua`), installed as the gamemode's own `PlayerCanHearPlayersVoice` wrapped around the rule it
already had (so a gag or mute addon always wins): a normal voice carries about 21 m and fades smoothly over its last 40 %, crouching
whispers (about 7 m), holding `+mentat_shout` shouts (about 46 m; the server remembers a shout for 1.5 s at a time), walls muffle.
`mentat_voice_mode` `proximity | global | off` (the clients are told, so global and off do not fade), `mentat_voice_range`,
`mentat_voice_wall`. Bind a key: `bind v +voicerecord` is the game's own; `bind x +mentat_shout`.

## Where the data came from

**Masses.** The library's masses are real-world masses from a sourced reference table, scaled to each model's size and held inside the
family's sourced range (`fidelity.py`, `data/fidelity.json`, report in `misc/HOLODECK_FIDELITY.md`); the holodeck gives each spawned
prop that mass. Six models keep the engine's gameplay mass because no source describes them (catalog `mass_status` "unaudited"); the
engine's original mass stays in the catalog as `engine_mass`. A separate audit (`audit_physics.py`, report in
`misc/HOLODECK_PHYSICS_AUDIT.md`) sets the ENGINE's mass, size and collision body beside what Deckard compiles for the same name; it
reports, it does not correct. Deckard's own mass and size defects found by that audit were fixed in `sigma_ground/deckard` (aliases match
only as the head noun, so "a desk lamp" is a lamp and compounds keep their own head noun; each part is voxelised on its own grid, so thin
boards, slender members, glazing and foliage get a mass that does not move with the grid resolution; masses are held to the sourced ranges
in `fidelity.py`, and the mass-sanity bands in `tests/test_deckard_mass_sanity.py` come from those ranges, with three strict xfails for
the cases still outside them; a hollow-shell occupancy rule that depends on thickness and material); the one left on purpose is the axis-orientation change, which moves
pinned scenes and needs its own change.
